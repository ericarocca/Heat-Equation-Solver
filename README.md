<h1>Heat equation numerical solutions</h1>
The heat equation is a parabolic partial differential equation (also known as PDE), which in one dimension is expressed as:

$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x^2} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$

where $x$ and $t$ are the spatial and time coordinates, $u$ is the temperature at the point of coordinates $x$ and $\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity of the medium.

The program aims to solve it using the Crank-Nicolson method, an implicit finite difference method.
